## 4. Data Analysis

Using the data stored in the database, we perform some analysis to get insights about the different aspects like pricing, peoples' preference, and rating of different food items/cuisines across different restaurants.

The analysis section is divided into 3 sub-sections:
1. Budget categories \[[link](./analysis_budget_categories.md)\]
2. Cuisines \[[link](./analysis_cuisines.md)\]
3. Pricing \[[link](./analysis_pricing.md)\]

For each sub-section, we mention the SQL query used, output, graph of the output, and the result discussion.
